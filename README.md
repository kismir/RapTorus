# RapTorus
"""
All good things have a name. 
The name that defines their essence.
Time to develop RapTorus - FE workspace.
"""
Overcoming this pathos lets begin with structurizing our work.

For now lets declare some rules(disputes are welcome) :

1.We admitted to make a workflow shedule(define time frame)

2.We accepted to divide our work onto significant parts to optimize wasted time

  -here i recomend to post your part(as i did):

    1.kismir: visualize project. Work on whole structure of complex
      -20 dec 2015 - define stack of tech.
      -10 jan 2016 - define mesh format
      -20 jan 2016 - mesh display 
      -1  feb 2016 - display nodes stresses and starins(node labels also)
      -10 feb 2016 -display interpolated stresses

    ...

3. We need to work out how Git works

4. Let's maintain this project being held in english



(pls correct mistakes of each other =p. I'll be glad if you do)

#5.02.16

okay. i've watched some analogues. python compatiable.

-FreeCAD (good CAD at all, cept assemblies ... this is quite strange)

-Code_Aster,open CASCADE, SALOME (these all are using cascade, tonns of code)

-sfepy (good library to be an example of how to write this system in python using bsd libs)

#Markdown 

Just realized that this file is markdown file (.md extension) ... 

Rearranged structure to fit style
